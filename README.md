# Cookie-Clicker-Source-Code
Welcome Fellow Cookie Clicker Fans


Any Clicker intrested in playing this modified version of the game will be warned,
as the challenge is virtually impossible

Here is the challenge... get 1,000,000,000 cookies...


Not that hard, right?


But I am not going to spoil the experience...


So get ready to play the *impossible cookie*!!!

P.S If you want an even more difficult challenge, do it without reloading the browser

2.021 source code for... educational purposes... <br>
Download and Extract to delete free time. Or just use the website. <br> <br>
Do not worry, I will be updating this to be up to date with the current Cookie Clicker version. <br>
